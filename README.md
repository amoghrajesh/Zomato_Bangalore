# Zomato_Bangalore
A simple recommendation system typically for the restaurants in Bangalore. 

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants

<b>Instructions for Execution of Project</b>:

“Restaurant_Recommendation_2.0” is the latest version of our project.
It contains 3 parts: 
  1)Data Preprocessing which contains cleaning up of all columns with various errors.
  2)Exploratory Data Analysis: Here we plotted a few types of graphs and drew some conclusions that helped us with our project / model.
  3)Recommendation Engine: Here we build a few functions that take the location, cuisine, cost for two, rating and suggest a few    restaurants based on the preferences of the user.

To run the final pipeline, run the python notebook and enter required inputs wherever prompted.
“Restaurant_Recommendation_1.0”  is a previous version of our code and it is processed further to form “Restaurant_Recommendation_2.0”.

The final notebook can be found in /Phase3/Restaurant_Recommendation_2.0
To execute only the recommendation part, run all the code blocks sequentially and enter your location, cuisine and cost whenever prompted. This will show you at most seven restaurants based on preferences.
